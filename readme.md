<h1> The Merchant Poem </h1> 
<h2> About This Project <br> </h2>
The Merchant Poem is an interactive media project featuring a personal narrative about my Land's Grandmother's wisdom and guidance in facing the world's challenges. Through a combination of my original poetry, a song I made, and AI-generated pixel artwork, this project creates an immersive visual journey that explores themes of heritage, perseverance, and continuous learning. <br><br>

Using p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding, the project serves as an introduction to creative coding. A new form of creating interactive literary installation, I have used this poem that I wrote to share some resources to aide in lifelong learning of whoever who sees this.

<h2> Project Overview </h2>  

This interactive web experience combines poetry, music, and pixel art in a unique digital format that creates an engaging narrative journey. The project merges traditional storytelling with modern creative coding techniques, presenting an innovative approach to interactive literary installations.
